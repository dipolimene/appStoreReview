# An API that pulls all review from a certain app in the Apple Store. 

It exports all reviews of a certain app in the apple store and displays it in the CONSOLE. 

It was developed using NodeJS with express and app-store-reviews dependencies.

It is expected to allow app owners pull all reviews made on their application.

The reviews-to-console.js demoes using a unique App ID which can be changed to yours at the .getReviews request.
